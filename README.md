# Hello!

You can use this seed file to set up a Postgres Sandbox.
Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Head to https://bit.io and create a new database (you'll need to create an account first too if you don't have one already)

2. Copy and paste the contents of `db.sql` from this repo into your new database

3. Use the bit.io interface to query your new db!
